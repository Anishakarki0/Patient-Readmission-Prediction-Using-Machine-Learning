# Patient-Readmission-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning to analyze hospital readmission patterns based on patient demographics, medical history, and treatment types. The model predicts whether a patient is likely to be readmitted, helping improve hospital care and reduce re-admission rates.
